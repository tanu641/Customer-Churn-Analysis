Customer Churn Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn to identify key factors affecting customer retention. The dataset includes demographic details, service usage, contract types, and payment methods to uncover insights into why customers leave and how retention can be improved.

Key Insights
Churn Rate: 26.54% of customers have churned, indicating a need for improved retention strategies.
Demographics: Senior citizens have a higher churn rate compared to younger customers.
Tenure Impact: Customers using the service for less than 2 months churn at 45%, while those staying for 2+ years have an 80% retention rate.
Contract Type: Month-to-month contract customers have 50% churn, whereas 2-year contract customers have a low churn rate of ~11%.
Service Influence: Lack of TechSupport, OnlineSecurity, and DeviceProtection increases churn risk.
Payment Methods: Customers using Electronic Check have a 40% churn rate, whereas those on Auto Payment or Credit Card have <15% churn.
Internet Type: Fiber Optic users churn more (~31%) compared to DSL users (~20%).
Data Processing & Analysis
Data Cleaning: Replaced blanks, converted categorical variables, and normalized data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used visualizations (bar charts, histograms, pie charts) to identify patterns.
Statistical Analysis: Compared churn rates across different customer segments.

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook

Recommendations
Improve early customer engagement to reduce churn in the first 2 months.
Promote long-term contracts with discounts to encourage retention.
